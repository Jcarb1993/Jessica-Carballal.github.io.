<h1> I am starting a new journey by learning how to code </h1>
<p> I've always wanted to learn a third language, and this is the time to do so. I have wroked in the financial industry for 5 years and i have learned many things, one of the most important ones, is that we rely heavily on technology.
I am committed to learn as much as I can and begin to write code. </p>
